<h2>Kevin’s Blog for however long it lasts</h2>

<p>
Hi, my name is Kevin, obviously. I live in Chicago now, but I did’t always. Also obviously.</p>

<p>
 I’m a smoker. I smoke about a pack every 3 days. That’s not how people usually introduce themselves, I know, but it’s kind of the main thing about this blog, and maybe about me, too. </p>

 I’ve been smoking since I was a kid. It kind of runs in the family (Hi mom!). I’ve been smoking Marlboro Golds for a long time now, and I’m ready to break out of my rut. There are enough food blogs in the world, but I’ve never seen a Cigarette blog, so enter: <em>Cigs in the City</em>, a blog for shitheads who want to watch me smoke myself to death. <em> Kidding!</em> I don’t really know who it’s a blog for yet, other than me. </p>
