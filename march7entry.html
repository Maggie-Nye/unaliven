<p>I’ve never really been a menthol guy but I figured if I’m doing this blog I’d better have a well rounded selection. Since this seems to be the most popular variety of menthol it seemed like a good place to start.</p>
<p>
First impression: holy shit they’re long. I forgot to take a picture, so here is an *artistic interpretation* for comparison:

 I’ve been smoking since I was a kid. It kind of runs in the family (Hi mom!). I’ve been smoking Marlboro Golds for a long time now, and I’m ready to break out of my rut. There are enough food blogs in the world, but I’ve never seen a cigarette blog, so enter: <em>Cigs in the City</em>, a blog for shitheads who want to watch me smoke myself to death. <em> Kidding!</em> I don’t really know who it’s a blog for yet, other than me. But if you're reading this and you have a request, leave me a comment. Maybe I'll read it. </p>
